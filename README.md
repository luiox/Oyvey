This is an Oyvey version maintained by Canrad. In this version, I will remove some redundant parts of the original project and strive to make the code of this project a more streamlined branch. Simple, easy to use and efficient are the goals of this project. At present, I am working on relevant code processing. Relevant precautions will be added to this file in succession. Please do not use these codes for your client development at present.

If you support this project, you can start and fork.
